USE CASE

Casillero exists because of the following requirements:

- Renaming/moving/linking files does not result in the whole file getting stored in the backup store again. In other words the size of the backup store is O(distinct blobs) not O(paths).
- Expiration / garbage cleanup
- Backup store is encrypted
- No need for local mirror of backup store.
- Reasonably fault-tolerant of shitty Internet connections and can resume interrupted backups reasonably close to where left off.

The combination of Git's orphan branch feature, and an encrypted filesystem like LUKS or Ecryptfs, would work for this use case if there were a reasonably stable way to mount the remote backup store as a local file system over a shitty Internet connection and not have commands like "umount" and "df -h" hang, or the backup store be left in an indeterminate state if a backup is interrupted or you force an umount. Hence casillero which lives entirely in userspace.
