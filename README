BLACKTAR

Content-addressed backup system for Amazon S3.

ABOUT

Blacktar backs up your data to S3.

Because Blacktar does not distinguish between "full" and "incremental" backups, you can back up only new content, or delete only old garbage, without ever having to re-do a "full" backup.

Because Blacktar saves and finds your files using their HMAC signatures instead of their pathnames, Blacktar won't re-backup unchanged contenet just because you've renamed or moved it.

Blacktar uses the Verity content tracking system to map between HMAC signatures and paths on your file system where content can be found or needs to be restored.

LIMITATIONS

You must back up your Verity database manually and independently of Blacktar.

When indexing your files with Verity, you must use full pathnames (with the leading "/") or Blacktar will not be able to link to your files from the tempdir while backing them up.

See the note in the Verity README on the importance of a correct system clock.

Blacktar will refuse to back up files that have changed since you last indexed them with verity_index_paths.  If it takes a long time for the index and backup to run on your data set, this could cause volatile files not to be backed up for an indefinite number of index-backup cycles.

Filenames will be visible to other users in the output of "ps".

Blacktar inherits the limitations of all its dependencies, including Verity and libs3.  See the documentation for those projects for more information.

Blacktar will not work with pathnames that are close to the system maximum length, because it concatenates the target root you specify for restoring with the original path you backed up.

This implementation of Blacktar is not cryptographically secure.  At a minimum, (1) the current implementations of Verity and Blacktar use the deprecated SHA-1 algorithm for calculating HMAC signatures; (2) this implementation of Blacktar uses the same passphrase for encryption as for the HMAC signatures; and (3) this implementation of Blacktar includes only a naive algorithm for obscuring file sizes, and even that is disabled by default to save storage space.

Blacktar does not use SSL for transmission to/from S3 because the data is already encrypted with GPG and using SSL would break compatibility with some older systems (that should be upgraded) where blacktar would otherwise run as designed.

The restore process is exceeding slow on some older versions of Postgres that don't realize they can use index scans to identify the paths referencing an inode.

INSTALLING

Blacktar was developed on Debian Linux and has not yet been compiled or tested on other systems.

Blacktar depends on Verity, which you can clone from github.com/michael-redman

Blacktar also depends on Brian Ischo's libs3 library, which you can get here: http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/1648

See the documentation for libs3 for installation instructions for that package.

Blacktar builds with the standard "make" and "make install" commands.

See the note in the Verity documentation about memory usage.  Blacktar also supports the QUERY_TYPE=CORRELATED_SUBQUERY make option.

USE

Example commands to index, backup, & restore a tree, and compare the restored tree to the original:

you@yourhost:~$ { find /some/tree/ -print0; verity_list_paths -p /some/tree/ dbname=verity_example_db; } | sort -uz | verity_index_paths dbname=verity_example_db <(echo -n "my passphrase")
you@yourhost:~$ export S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
you@yourhost:~$ export S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
you@yourhost:~$ blacktar_backup -p /some/tree/ dbname=verity_example_db <(echo -n "my passphrase") s3_bucket_name
you@yourhost:~$ blacktar_restore -p /some/tree/ dbname=verity_example_db <(echo -n "my passphrase") s3_bucket_name /tmp/new-root/
you@yourhost:~$ diff -r /some/tree/ /tmp/new-root/some/tree/

If you do not specify a path prefix with -p like in the example, Blacktar will back up or restore all files in your Verity database.

You may also specify a Unix timestamp as the -t option to blacktar_restore, which will restore the paths to the state as of the most recent Verity indexing less than or equal to the time you specifiey.  e.g., -t `date -d '20140214' +%s`

The backup and restore commands pass the database connection string to libpq unmodified.  See the libpq documentation for the full syntax.

There is a bug affecting Blacktar and the above example on user accounts where gpg has never been run before.  Blacktar does not recognize messages like "gpg: directory `/home/ec2-user/.gnupg' created" as benign, and will abort backing up the current file.  Blacktar will backup any aborted files on the next run(s) when gpg is done printing its setup messages, or you can work around the bug entirely by manually encrypting a file with gpg before ever running blacktar_backup.

If the "s3" command gives you an error about not being able to find a shared library, you may need to run ldconfig on libs3's lib directory (probably /usr/local/lib?)

IN GOD WE TRVST.
