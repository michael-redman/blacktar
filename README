Content-addressed backup system for Amazon S3.

ABOUT

Blacktar backs up your files to S3, encrypted by GNUPG, and indexed by the SHA-256 HMACs of the files' SHA-256 hashes.

This "content-addressed" design means that Blacktar only stores 1 copy of a file no matter how many copies are on your filesystem; Blacktar never has to re-back up unchanged files that have only been moved or renamed; you can make as many incremental backups as you want or clean up old garbage from the backup store without ever having to re-do a "full" backup; and Blacktar can resume an interrupted backup without re-transferring any files.

Blacktar also caches a list of which hashes are on S3 so it doesn't have to list out your S3 bucket each backup run.

Blacktar uses the Verity content tracking system to map between hashes and paths on your file system where content can be found or needs to be restored.
